# Datastructure

## What is Data structure?
- Organising data in organised way. for example if you need cooper wire from store..if they are in messed up with other wires it will be very hard to find that.. but in our daily store they orgainsed in way..so that's data structure

## What is Alogithm?
- Set of rules to solve a problem
ex: for making a tea.. you have to put water, tea leaves, milk , sugar..and then put it on stove.. so these are set of rules to solve a problem.and here problem is to make a tea.

## Recursion
calling same method again and again

ex. 
- finding factorial
- finding fibonacci

### comparision recursion and iteration
| Ways  | Recursion better  | Iteration better| Description |
| :------------: |:---------------:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Space Complexity     | No | Yes | Interally system is using stack as memory but for iteration we are using variables |
| Time Complexity     | No        | Yes | System is using stack in recursion so it will take time to push and pop |
| Ease of code (to solve subproblem) | Yes       |   No | When there is case when we can divide the problem in simlar problems then Recursion will help to divide in subproblems which is better approch |


### When to avoid and use Recursion
- When we can divide problem into simlar problems then we have to use recursion
- when there is no bound for time and space then we can use recursion. for example we have to program for air bag..in which case time is crucial point and another example embedded system where storage is important point.. so at these places we have to avoid using recursion

### Practical uses
- stack
- Tree - Traversal/Insertion/Deletion/Searching
- Sorting - Quick and Merge sort
- Divide and conqur
- Dynamic Programming and many more.

## Algorithm Run Time Analysis
Study of given alogo's running time by increasing input size or simply we can say how much time alogo takes to run with different inputs. or Its a measurement of performance of given alogrithm

### Notations
- Omega(Ω)
  It will give Lower bound of algo.
  
  for example , entry of 10k elements will not be less then 10 sec, it will be more than 10 sec like 11 sec , 12 sec
  
  case where we may need it : when we have allocate resources.

- Big-O(O)
  It will give upper bound of alog. (worst case and best case both measured)
  
  for example , entry of 10k elements will not take more than 100 secs , it will be less like 92, 90 sec
  
  case where we may need it : programming air bag system.In this case we have to be known in worst case how much time it will take to deploy air bag.
  
- Theta (0)
  It will give averge time of an algo. or we can say upper bound and lower bound of an alogrithm are same or not
  
  for example , entry of 10k elements with various input gives different output ex 10,50,100 so theta is near about 50 as average.
  

### Example:
5,2,4,...lakhs,1,10  given that it will take 1 unit of time to check number

Omega(Ω) = seaching minimum time : 1 unit to search 5 so Ω is `Ω(1)`

Big-O(O) = let total number is `n` , so finding number 10 will take n units of time so `O(n)`

Theta (0) =   average time : n/2 so `0(n/2)`

Usefull : for chess algos
checking for possible moves and then checking again from those possible moves
# Graphs

Usefull:

# Greedy ALGO
it check what is best at that point not overall so its not used for efficieny
ex : https://youtu.be/kp3fCihUXEg?list=PLUITAQK78D8PByrC3XDuF-elzSK7QWXO5&t=1009

so if problem is very complex and you don't want exact outcome then use greedy
ex [Travelling salesman problem](https://youtu.be/kp3fCihUXEg?list=PLUITAQK78D8PByrC3XDuF-elzSK7QWXO5&t=1119) 


## Details of Algos
### BST
Binary Tree having upto 2 child nodes
Binary search tree is type of Binary Tree having left `nodes` is less than parent node and right `nodes` is greater than parent node.
lets take example : 
8(P)- 2(L)-15(R)
2(P)- 1(L)-10(R)

so this is not a BST because 10 is greater than 8 but its greater than 2 and right side of 2

so values Goes from -∞ to +∞
if parent is 8 then for left side values should be between -∞ to 8 and right side nodes should be between 8 to +∞

check its BST OR NOT - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-bst/1
insert node - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insert-a-node-in-a-bst/1

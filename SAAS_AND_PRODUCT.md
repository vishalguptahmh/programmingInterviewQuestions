It is a cloud-based software delivery model where customers pay for software products on a subscription basis.


### [IAM](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management) - Identity Access Management

Identity and access management provides control over user validation and resource access. Commonly known as IAM, this technology ensures that the right people access the right digital resources at the right time and for the right reasons.

In IAM, a user account is a digital identity. User accounts can also represent non-humans, such as software, Internet of Things devices, or robotics.

IAM is a discipline and a type of framework for solving the challenge of secure access to digital resources.

Authentication is the verification of a digital identity. Someone (or something) authenticates to prove that they’re the user they claim to be. 

Authorization is the process of determining what resources a user can access. 

authentication proves a user’s identity, while authorization grants or denies the user’s access to certain resources. 

### [Identity Providers](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management#identity-providers)
Its very difficult to create account,login to multiple applications and filling forms.
its very hard to remember all password also

here comes IP which will create your information and give rights to other application that you are valid idenity.

Identity providers don’t share your authentication credentials with the apps that rely on them. Slate, for example, doesn’t ever see your Google password. Google only lets Slate know that you’ve proven your identity. 

 Other identity providers include social media (such as Facebook or LinkedIn), enterprise (such as Microsoft Active Directory), and legal identity providers (such as Swedish BankID).


### Authentication Factors
Authentication factors are methods for proving a user’s identity. IAM systems require one or many authentication factors to verify identity.They commonly fall into these basic types:

| Factor type | Examples |
| -------- | -------- |
| Knowledge (something you know)   | Pin, password  |
| Possession (something you have)  | Mobile phone, encryption key device   |
| Inherence (something you are)    | Fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan  |


Authentication and authorization standards are open specifications and protocols

Below IAM industry standards are considered the most secure, reliable, and practical to implement:

- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID connect (OIDC)
- json web tokens (JWTs)
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup langaguge)
- WS-FED
-
